The inerrancy of the 66 books of the Christian Bible. The tri-unity of the Godhead. All of mankind has sinned, fallen short of the glory of God, and is subject to His wrath, incapable of returning to Him. The gospel is the good news of God revealed in the life, death, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus.  Jesus Christ is the only mediator between God and man and there is no other name by which mankind can be saved.  Salvation is the free gift of God provided by grace alone through faith. Jesus builds his church by calling sinful people from all nations, races, ethnicities, and sinful natures into relationships with himself and one another.  You and/or your organization are called to love God with all your heart, soul, and mind. You are also called to love your neighbor as yourself. Because of this love, you recognize a calling to make disciples of all nations, races, ethnicities, and sinful natures, baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, teaching them to obey all that Jesus commanded you.
